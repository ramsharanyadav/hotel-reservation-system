# Hotel Room Reservation System (Angular 11)

## 📌 Problem Statement
A hotel has **97 rooms** across **10 floors**:
- Floors 1–9 → 10 rooms each (e.g., 101–110, 201–210).
- Floor 10 → 7 rooms (1001–1007).
- Booking rules:
  - A guest can book up to 5 rooms.
  - Prefer booking on the same floor.
  - If not possible, minimize travel time (horizontal = 1 min, vertical = 2 min).
- Deliverables:
  - Form to enter number of rooms and book them.
  - Visualization of bookings.
  - Button to generate random occupancy.
  - Button to reset bookings.
